ðŸ“· **Testing & Camera Module Verification**

After successfully completing the installation of all required packages and libraries for the sAfe steP project, we carried out a testing phase to ensure everything was working properly.

âœ… First, we tested the installed libraries and verified that they were functioning without errors.

âœ… Next, we executed sample programs to check whether the Raspberry Pi camera module was working correctly.

âœ… The camera module was successfully detected and captured images/videos as expected.


To keep proof of our practical testing, we also recorded video clips while performing these steps. These recordings serve as evidence that the installation was done correctly and that the camera module is fully functional in our setup.

You can view the testing process and camera verification in the video provided below.
